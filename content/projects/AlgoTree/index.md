The `AlgoTree` package provides a comprehensive suite of utilities for working with tree-like data structures in Python. It supports various tree representations, including `FlatTree` and `TreeNode`, along with a host of utilities, algorithms, visualizations, and common operations on trees.

I designed `AlgoTree` (algorithmic trees) to be extensible and also self-contained,
with a particular focus on enabling piping and chaining operations on tree-like data structures, including on the command line, which is a common use case for data manipulation and analysis. Since it deals with tree-like structures, we pass along JSON data,
although visualizations (which are pretty strings) are also supported.

I am in the process of developing the command line tools. They will use
the `AlgoTree` package to do all of the heavy lifting. I also plan on supporting
CSV and other data formats using a compatible flat-tree representation.
