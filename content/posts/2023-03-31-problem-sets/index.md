I have a fairly broad interest in problem-solving, from problems in statistics
to algorithms. Over the years, I've accumulated a collection of problem sets,
which I will be refining and posting here every now and then.

You can find these problem sets on various topics [here](https://metafunctor.com/#prob-sets).
It's accessible through the menu bar as well. Please note that while I don't
claim expertise in all areas, these materials may still provide valuable insights.
