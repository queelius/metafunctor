### About

I gave a presentation for the St. Louis Unix Users Group (SLUUG) about Large Language Models (LLMs) on Linux. The talk was titled "Demystifying Large Language Models (LLMs) on Linux: From Theory to Application". The talk was about the theory behind LLMs, how they work, and how to use them on Linux.

I also demoed two projects:

1. A simple Colab notebook that uses very simple Python code to generate text 
usnig an n-gram model to illustrate the basic idea behind LLMs and why the
n-gram model falls short.

2. A project that uses ElasticSearch and LLMs to allow for search queries over
databases using natural language.

The talk was well-received and I had a great time giving it. I'm looking forward to giving more talks in the future. 
The content for the talk can be found [here](https://github.com/queelius/sluug-talk-llm).
