[digistar](https://github.com/queelius/digistar) is aiming to be an advanced sandbox space simulation game.
This project leverages GPU acceleration and optimized data structures like octrees to create a highly interactive and scalable sandbox for large n-body systems. By simulating interactions between millions of "big atoms" through fundamental forces, players can explore dynamic celestial mechanics, engage in rich multiplayer experiences, and experiment with novel physics phenomena. The goal is to provide a deeply immersive environment with realistic physics and efficient performance, supporting a large number of concurrent players and AI bots.
