      <title>Review: A Symbolic Representation of Time Series, with Implications for Streaming Algorithms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In [1], the authors present a method for constructing a symbolic (nominal) representation for real-valued time series data. A symbolic representation is desirable because then it becomes possible to use many of the effective algorithms that require symbolic representation, like hashing and Markov models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The authors claim that one of the most useful time series operations is measuring the similarity between two time series data sets. To do this on the original time series, the Euclidean distance formula can be used. Therefore, for a time series transformation to be useful, distance measures applied to the corresponding transformations should provide some guaranteed lower bound on the &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; distance. This is a basic requirement for almost all time series algorithms in data mining. Non-symbolic transformations like Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) models have this lower-bounding property. However, the authors claim no previously proposed symbolic representations do, which limits their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
