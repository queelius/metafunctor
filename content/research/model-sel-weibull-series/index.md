title: "Model Selection in Weibull Series Systems"

slug: reliability-estimation-in-series-systems-model-sel
summary: "In my paper, Reliability Estimation in Series Systems, I discarded
a lot of research that may be interesting to pursue further. This one is about
using homogeneous shape parameters for the Weibull series system, which can
greatly simplify the analysis and reduce the number of parameters to estimate.
It's also quite reasonable for most well-designed systems."

The repo on [Github](https://github.com/queelius/reliability-estimation-in-series-systems-model-selection) contains the prelimniary
work. It follows from the Future Work section in the paper, which is [here](/alex-towell-math-proj-masters.pdf#page=31).
In particular, it explores the homogenous shape parameter Weiibull series system, which is a simplification of the model
and results in a system with a lifetime that is itself Weibull distributed.
