The R package `wei.series.md.c1.c2.c3` is a narrow library I developed in support of my master's project
at SIUe in mathematics and statistics. I made a post about the project [here](/post/masters-stats-siue-proj).
It provides a set of functions for fitting Weibull series systems with masked failure data.
See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/queelius/wei.series.md.c1.c2.c3) for more details.
