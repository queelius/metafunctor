## README
# ChatGPT chat search

This was the first python app I developed in quite some time. I wanted to host ChatGPT logs, experiment with heroku, and see how easy it would be to develop the search app using nothing but ChatGPT. I've hosted the entire chat log that directly generated this app in this repo. It's nothing special, but it's interesting to see my early efforts at using ChatGPT.

You can see the chat log here: https://queelius.github.io/chatgpt-pysearch/index.html

The herok app is hosted here: https://chatgpt.metafunctor.com/
