A set of numeric MLE solvers.

This is very early alpha. I just started this project and it is not
ready for use yet. I just took a bunch of numerical code from
`algebraic.mle` and put it in this separate package. I will be adding
more numerical solvers and more examples in the future. Most of the code
probably does not even work yet, since I havenâ€™t tested it.

## Installation

You can install `numerical.mle` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/queelius/numerical.mle) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("queelius/numerical.mle")
```

## API

A set of methods for fitting log-likelihood functions to data. We
provide various adapters for log-likelihood functions, including penalty
adapters (for constrained MLEs) and transformation adapters (for
transformed MLEs).

The object representing a fitted model is a type of `mle` object, the
maximum likelihood estimator of the model with respect to observed data.
We use the R package for this purpose. (See
[here](https://github.com/queelius/algebraic.mle)).

The API mostly consists of generic methods with implementations for
various `mle` type objects. For a full list of functions, see the
[function
reference](https://queelius.github.io/numerical.mle/reference/index.html)
for `numerical.mle`.

## Examples

### Fitting a linear regression model

``` r
library(numerical.mle)
library(algebraic.mle)
```
