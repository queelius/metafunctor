about_text: "As a versatile computer scientist and mathematician, I blend theoretical knowledge with practical skills across a wide range of technologies. My expertise spans artificial intelligence, data science, and information security, complemented by extensive experience in full-stack development. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, as well as API and library development, as evidenced by my numerous GitHub repositories. Driven by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning, I strive to create innovative solutions that bridge complex theories with real-world applications. My academic background and hands-on experience have equipped me to approach problems creatively, develop robust software systems, and effectively communicate technical concepts. I am committed to leveraging my diverse skill set to drive innovation and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape."
research_interests:
  - title: "Reliability Engineering"
    description: "Developing new techniques for estimating component reliability from masked failure data in series systems. My work has focused on maximum likelihood techniques for right-censored and masked failure data, and I have investigated the accuracy and precision of maximum likelihood estimates under varying sample size, masking probability, and right-censoring time for components with Weibull lifetimes."
  - title: "Encrypted Search"
    description: "Designing secure index types to enable standard information retrieval techniques while preserving confidentiality. I have examined the risk to confidentiality posed by storing frequency and proximity information, and I have suggested ways to mitigate the risk. I have also investigated the impact of false positives and secure index poisoning on performance and confidentiality, and explored techniques to protect against adversaries with access to encrypted query histories, such as query obfuscation."
  - title: "Data Analysis and Machine Learning"
    description: "Working on projects involving predictive modeling, classification, clustering, and natural language processing. I have developed models to predict customer churn, identify fraudulent transactions, and classify text data."
  - title: "Statistical Learning"
    description: "I have experience in statistical learning and have worked on projects involving hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. I have developed models to estimate component reliability, predict customer churn, and classify text data."
