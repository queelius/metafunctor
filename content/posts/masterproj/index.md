To complete my masters degree in statistics/mathematics at SIUe I presented my
master's project in October 2023. Their was also a paper associated with the project
titled "Reliability Estimation in Series Systems: Maximum Likelihood Techniques
for Right-Censored and Masked Failure Data".

See the project [here](/project/reliability-estimation-in-series-systems).
