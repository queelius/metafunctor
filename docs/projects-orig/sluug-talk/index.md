I recently presented at the St. Louis Unix Users Group (SLUUG) on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application on Linux. The talk, titled "Demystifying Large Language Models (LLMs) on Linux: From Theory to Application," covered the theoretical foundations of LLMs, how they operate, and practical ways to utilize them in a Linux environment.

During the presentation, I demonstrated two projects:

1. **N-gram Model Example**: A simple Colab notebook showcasing basic Python code to generate text using an n-gram model. This illustrated the fundamental concept behind LLMs and highlighted the limitations of the n-gram approach.
   
2. **ElasticSearch with LLMs**: A project that integrates ElasticSearch and LLMs to enable natural language search queries over databases.

The talk was well-received, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I'm excited about the possibility of delivering more talks in the future.
